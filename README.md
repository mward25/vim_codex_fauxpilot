This is a fork of [vim_codex](https://github.com/tom-doerr/vim_codex) designed to work with [fauxpilot](https://github.com/fauxpilot/fauxpilot). It is currently very simple, so for more integrated support, you should probably see https://github.com/fauxpilot/fauxpilot/discussions/72. However I will continue to tinker with this repository for fun.

NOTE: you need to have the openai python library installed, other wise the plugin will not work. Vim also has to be compiled with python support enabled.

ALSO NOTE: I disabled the "co" completion command as it seemed to be interfering with another plugin I had. I have these lines in my .vimrc for completion shortcuts for this plugin:\n
    - nnoremap  ,C a<Space><Esc>:CreateCompletion<CR>\n
    - nnoremap  ,c a<Space><Esc>:CreateCompletionLine<CR>

This is a simple plugin for Vim that will allow you to use OpenAI Codex.
To use this plugin you need to get access to OpenAI's [Codex API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/).



## Installation

The easiest way to install the plugin is to install it as a bundle.
For example, using [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen):

1. Get and install [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen). You can skip this step
   if you already have it installed.

2. `cd ~/.vim/bundle`

3. `git clone git@github.com:tom-doerr/vim_codex.git`

Bundle installs are known to work fine also when using [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle). Other
bundle managers are expected to work as well.



After installing the plugin, you need to install the openai package::
```
pip3 install openai
```

After running `:CreateCompletion` once, the file `~/.config/openaiapirc` is created where you need to enter your OpenAI authentication information.
You can find your authentication information on the [website](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).



## Usage
The plugin provides a `CreateCompletion` command which you can call by default using the mapping 
`<Leader>co`.
You can give the `CreateCompletion` command the number of tokens it should produce as an argument, e.g. `CreateCompletion 1000`.
If you want to just complete the current line, run `CreateCompletionLine`.

To complete the current text from insert and normal mode using Ctrl+x, you can add the following
lines to your .vimrc::
```
nnoremap  <C-x> :CreateCompletion<CR>
inoremap  <C-x> <Esc>li<C-g>u<Esc>l:CreateCompletion<CR>
```


## Updating

### Manually

In order to update the plugin, go to its bundle directory and use
Git to update it:

1. `cd ~/.vim/bundle/vim_codex`

2. `git pull`


### With Vundle

Use the `:BundleUpdate` command provided by Vundle, for example invoking
Vim like this::
```
% vim +BundleUpdate
```
